### Machines
You are given three machines to use for your license.<br>
We consider a "machine" as a root machine, not a virtual machine.<br>
A root machine with multiple virtual machines running Intave is indifferent from running Intave on the root machine.<br>
If you need more than three machines, you can get more machine-slots for 10 EUR each.
