# Machines

Intave is hardware-locked, meaning that Intave won't start on a machine you have not verified.
To ensure that users can't give unlimited machines access, the amount of concurrent machines is limited to three machines.

## Verify

To verify a machine, visit the Hardware section 
on the [Intave dashboard](https://app.intave.com) and accept pending requests.

If you do not recognize a verification request, contact us.

## Remove

You can also remove a machine, which will prevent Intave from starting there.

## Get more

If you want to get more machines, you can purchase additional machines for 10 EUR each.
Contact us via discord or email for that.
