# Bootstrap

There is another easier process to install Intave. **Intave Bootstrap**

## What does this do?

This plugin will automatically use the *last stable* version of Intave (although you can change the configuration, so it
downloads the *latest version*). It only downloads new versions when required, saving up bandwidth.

## How to setup

<a href="https://intave.de/go/bootstrap">Download</a> the bootstrap jar, put it in your plugin folder, go to your Intave account
settings, generate and copy your `authentication key`, put it in the configuration file /IntaveBootstrap/config.yml.

## Is it safe?

Make sure nobody has access to your `authentication key`, otherwise generate a new authentication key. You are
responsible for possible damages.
