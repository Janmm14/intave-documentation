# Getting started
## Purchase

If you don't own a license for Intave yet, you should purchase one:

0. Before purchasing Intave, please make yourself familiar with the [EULA](https://policy.intave.de/eula). Please note
   that you are in particular not allowed to:

   * Decompile, debug, leak, crack or modify Intave
   * Create a public or private test server and/or let third parties test Intave

1. Visit the [purchase page](https://app.intave.de/purchase).
2. Press the `Purchase` button. This will redirect you to our payment gateway (PayPal). After you completed your
   purchase, you will be redirected back to the Intave website.
3. You are now able to [download Intave](https://app.intave.de/download).

## Setup

There are several ways to set up Intave:

* [Intave Bootstrap](/guide/i02-bootstrap.html): This allows for automatic downloading and updating of Intave.
* Manual Installation: This involves manually downloading updates for Intave.

This section covers the manual installation.

### Download

1. If you haven't downloaded Intave yet, please do so now. Visit the [download page](https://app.intave.de/download) and
   download the `Latest` branch.
2. Copy the `.jar` file into your server's `plugins` folder. Please keep in mind Intave is a **Spigot** plugin, not a
   BungeeCord plugin. You can add BungeeCord support to Intave by using [Proxy Support](/guide/i03-proxy.html).
3. Start your server and Intave should load, notifying you with an error that your hardware is not verified.

### Hardware Verification

To ensure the legitimate use of your license, you must verify your hardware before being able to use Intave. Luckily,
this step is a matter of two clicks.

1. Please visit the [hardware page](https://app.intave.de/hardware).
2. You will see all your currently verified server hardware. Additionally, you will see verification requests if your
   Intave license has been used on a machine not currently verified.
3. Please carefully review any verification requests. **If you do not recognize a verification request, please contact
   us immediately â€“ your license may be in danger!** Once you have reviewed the request details, you can verify the
   machine with a simple click.
4. Start your server once again. Now, Intave should load without any errors.

### Security

Please carefully consider who has access to your servers. You are responsible for the safety of your Intave license and
may be held liable for possible damages. **If you notice any suspicious activity or leaks, please contact us
immediately.** We can help you mitigate any fraudulent activity involving your Intave license.
