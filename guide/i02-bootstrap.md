# Bootstrap

We have released an auto-updater for Intave, IntaveBootstrap.

*What does this do?*
This plugin will automatically use the *last stable* version of Intave.
It only downloads new versions when required, saving up bandwidth.

*How to setup*
Download the bootstrap jar (https://intave.de/go/bootstrap), put it in your plugin folder, go to your Intave account settings, generate and copy your `authentication key`, put it in the configuration file /IntaveBootstrap/config.yml.

*Is it safe?*
Make sure nobody has access to your `authentication key`, otherwise generate a new authentication key.
You are responsible for possible damages.
