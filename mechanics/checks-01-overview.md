# Overview
### What is a check?

A check is an algorithm or algorithm cluster designed to find and mitigate aspects of cheating.

Each check is responsible for covering a fairly large part of the spectrum, seeking high efficiency and accuracy,
each with a different purpose, goal and structure.

<!--
All checks combined should cover the entire spectrum of cheats.
