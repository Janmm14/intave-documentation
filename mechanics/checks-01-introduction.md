# Checks

## What is a check?
A check is an algorithm or algorithm cluster designed to find and mitigate aspects of cheating.<br>
Each check is responsible for covering a fairly large part of the spectrum, seeking high efficiency and accuracy,
each with a different purpose, goal and structure.<br>
All checks combined should cover the entire spectrum of cheats.<br>

## Example checks

* The check **Physics** tries to find **all movement deviations**, like Fly, Speed, and Velocity
* The check **AttackRaytrace** tries to find **all reach/hitbox cheats**
* and the check **Heuristics** tires to find **killaura and combat related cheats**

## How many checks are there?

We have 11 checks in total,
[**AttackRaytrace**](/mechanics/checks-02-attackraytrace.md), [**BreakSpeedLimiter**](/mechanics/checks-03-breakspeedlimiter.md), **ClickPatterns**, **ClickSpeedLimiter**,
[**Heuristics**](/mechanics/checks-06-heuristics.md), **InteractionRaytrace**, **InventoryClickAnalysis**, [**Physics**](/mechanics/checks-09-physics.md), **PlacementAnalysis**,
**ProtocolScanner**, and **Timer**.
