# ClickPatterns

`Name` ClickPatterns<br>
`Coverage` Click automation cheats<br>
`Developers` Richy, Lucky<br>
`Since` Intave 14<br>

### Issue

To gain an advantage in 1.8 combat, players try to click as fast as possible. Cheaters try to achieve this through the
use of macros or autoclickers.

### Detection

Intave searches for patterns in the click behavior of a player to determine if they are using an autoclicker.

### Accuracy

As this check is relatively new, it has not yet been tested extensively. We do not recommend banning players for
detections.

### Issues

ClickPatterns is highly experimental currently and may produce false detections. Additionally, unnatural clicking
techniques like "butterfly clicking" or "drag clicking"/"mouse abuse" may get detected.
