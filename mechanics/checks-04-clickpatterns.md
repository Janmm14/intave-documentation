# ClickPatterns

`Name` ClickPatterns<br>
`Coverage` Click automation cheats<br>
`Developers` Jpx3, iTz_Lucky<br>
`Since` Intave 14<br>

### Issue
By using macros or autoclickers, players gain a significant advantage by clicking very fast.
Advantages include attack-slowdown/reducing and a significantly higher chance of earlier attacks.

### Detection
Intave searches for patterns in the click behavior of a player to determine if they are using an autoclicker.

### Accuracy
As this check is relatively new, it has not yet been tested extensively. We do not recommend banning players for
detections.

### Issues
ClickPatterns is currently unstable, just use it for testing purposes.
