# Trustfactor

A trust factor is either<br>
:white_large_square: White (`intave.bypass`)<br>
ğŸŸ© Green (`intave.trust.green`)<br>
ğŸŸ¨ Yellow (`intave.trust.yellow`)<br>
ğŸŸ§ Orange (`intave.trust.orange`)<br>
ğŸŸ¥ Red (`intave.trust.red`)<br>
ğŸŸ¥ Dark-Red (`intave.trust.darkred`)<br>
and every player will have one assigned.<br>

Only use trust-factor permissions when [intave/access](https://github.com/intave/access) is not an option for you.<br>
