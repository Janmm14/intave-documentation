### How to assign trust factors
Intave does not choose trust factors by itself. You will have to - either with
[intave/access](https://github.com/intave/access) or with good old permissions, otherwise we will just assign the ðŸŸ§
Orange Trust Factor or a different given default.

Only set the trust factor through permissions when [intave/access](https://github.com/intave/access) is not an option
for you.
