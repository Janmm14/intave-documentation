`Name` Heuristics<br>
`Coverage` Fight/Click automation cheats<br>
`Developers` Richy, DarkAndBlue, vento<br>
`Since` Intave/14<br>

### How it works
By analyzing player combat over longer periods (30-60 seconds), the check decides how likely a player is cheating, making it very hard to bypass and very effective long-term.<br>
Each detection will generate a unique identifier, helpful if you want to report false positives.<br>
How this check internally works will remain a permanent secret.<br>
### Accuracy
Heuristics is a sophisticated and well-tested fight-automation detection that notices, mitigates and removes even privately created combat cheats, targeted towards Intave.
### Alternatives
To our current knowledge, no better alternative approach mitigating fight-automation cheats exists.
A full distinction from legitimate behaviour is even with a complete protocol overhaul not possible.
### Issues
Albeit hard, it is and always will be theoretically possible to bypass this check.
